# Simple BTHomev2 Implementation for ESP-IDF (or others?)

This package, initially provided by [Christos Baltatzidis](https://github.com/Chreece/BTHomeV2-ESP32-example), simplifies interfacing with the NimBLE stack via [esp-nimble-cpp](https://github.com/h2zero/esp-nimble-cpp) for the purpose of sending BTHome v2 packets. This version has been modified to remove depedencies on Arduino-specific code, allowing it to be used wherever C++ and esp-nimble-cpp are available.
